# Hello, I'm Maria Ijeoma Egbuna ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught data analyst with a B.S.c in Computer Science. My passion lies in transforming raw data into meaningful insights and compelling stories. I love using a variety of analytics tools to discover hidden narratives and tell stories through powerful visualizations.

I am actively building a portfolio of projects that showcase my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
